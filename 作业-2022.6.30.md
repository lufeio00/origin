# **React**

react is aJacaScript library for building suer interfaces.

*   **Declarative**:React makes it painless to create interactive UIs.Design simple views for each state in your application,and React will efficiently update and render just the right components wherstand,and easire to debug.

*   **Component-Based**:Build encapsulated components that manage their state,then compose them to make comples Uls.Since component logic is written in javaScript instead of templates, you can easily pass rich data through your app and keep the state out of the DOM.

*   **Learn Once,Write Anywhere**:We don't make assumptions about the rest of your technology stack,so you can develop new features in React without rewriting existing code.React can also render on the server suing Node and power mobile apps using [React Native](http://www.baidu.com).
