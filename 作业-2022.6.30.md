# **React**

react is aJacaScript library for building suer interfaces.

*   **Declarative**:React makes it painless to create interactive UIs.Design simple views for each state in your application,and React will efficiently update and render just the right components wherstand,and easire to debug.

*   **Component-Based**:Build encapsulated components that manage their state,then compose them to make comples Uls.Since component logic is written in javaScript instead of templates, you can easily pass rich data through your app and keep the state out of the DOM.

*   **Learn Once,Write Anywhere**:We don't make assumptions about the rest of your technology stack,so you can develop new features in React without rewriting existing code.React can also render on the server suing Node and power mobile apps using [React Native](http://www.baidu.com).

## Lnstallation



React has been designed for gradual adoption from the start,and you use as little or as much React as you need:

*   Use[Online Playgrounds](http://www.baidu.com) toget a taste of React.

*   [Add React to a Website](http://www.baidu.com) as a tag in one minute.`<script>`
*   [Create a New React App](http://www.baidu.com) if you're looking for a powerful JacaScript toolchain.

You can use React as a tag from a [CDN](http://www.baidu.com), or as a package on [npm](http://www.baidu.com), `<script> react`

## Examples

We have several examples on the website. here is the first one to get you started:

```css
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';

function HelloMessage({ name }) {
  return <div>Hello {name}</div>;
}

const root = createRoot(document.getElementById('container'));
root.render(<HelloMessage name="Taylor" />);
```
This example will render "Hello Taylor" into a container on the page.

You'll notice that we used an HTML-like syntax;[we call it JSX](http://www.baidu.com). JSX is not required to use React, but it makes code more readable and writing it feels like writing HTML.lf you're using React as a tag.read [this section](http://www.baidu.com) on integrating JSX; otherwise, the [recommended JavaScript toolchains] handle it automatically,`<script>`
